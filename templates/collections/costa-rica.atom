<p>Embark on an expedited path to residency in the enchanting country of Costa Rica through the Bitcoin Capitalist's exceptional expertise in residency by investment. We present you with two viable options to obtain residency:</p>
<p>Investor Option: By investing $150,000 in various avenues such as real estate, vehicles (excluding corporations), investment funds, or shares of an active corporation, you lay the foundation for your residency by investment journey.</p>
<p>Rentista Option: Simply depositing $60,000 into a Costa Rican bank account opens doors to residency in this tropical haven.</p>
<p>Our streamlined process involves three simple steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Compilation Stage (7-10 days) During this stage, we gather the necessary documents to initiate the process swiftly. We require a clear photo of your passport, along with its information and stamp. Our team will prepare a power of attorney and an informed consent document, which you will print, sign, and send back to us. We coordinate with a notary for passport certification (USD $40) and a translator for translation (USD $35). Additionally, we assist you in obtaining your birth certificate and FBI/Royal Mounted Police criminal records, duly apostilled. Registry before the police department and your Consulate/Embassy is also facilitated. If pursuing the investor option, we gather documentation regarding the investment, or if opting for rentista, documentation related to the bank deposit.</p>
<p>Step 2: Online Application for Residency (1-45 days) Our team handles the online application process, which spans two stages. In the first stage, we submit the required documents to the migration office, awaiting their response within 1-30 days. We also gather information about your parents' full names. In the second stage, we apply for the residency category, with a response expected within 1-15 days. Payments during this stage include a USD $112 application fee, along with 50% of our honoraries.</p>
<p>Step 3: Documentation Stage (1-90 days) Upon receiving a resolution approving your digital nomad visa, you are granted 90 days to complete the process. We assist in scheduling an appointment for your picture and ID card issuance. Additional payments include $128 for the ID card and a guarantee deposit. Insurance before social security is also necessary.</p>
<p>With the Bitcoin Capitalist as your trusted partner, achieving residency by investment in Costa Rica becomes a streamlined and efficient journey. Experience the splendors of this tropical paradise while enjoying the benefits and opportunities that come with your new residency status.</p>
