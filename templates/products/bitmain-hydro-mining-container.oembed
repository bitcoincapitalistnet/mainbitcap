Each container order requires a minimum complement of 210 S19\/S21 Hydro units. Consisting of a cooling tower and a mining container, the AntSpace HK3 V6 is sold as a two-piece stackable set, detailed in the brochure available for download.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to Bitmain, we offer DDP (delivery duty paid) service for the ASIC miners but not for the container. The price of the AntSpace excludes door-to-door ocean freight, with freight costs to be provided at the time of loading due to weekly variations and location-specific rates. ExWorks \/ FOB incoterms are also available, and a 1-year manufacturer warranty is included. Please note that the warranty for the S19 Pro+ Hydro is void if used outside the AntSpace HK3 V6 system. Coolant is not included but can be ordered separately.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCustomers have the option to select the cooling tower type suitable for their local climate, with options including the EC1 DWT for hot climates (10°C to 40°C), which holds major global certifications, and the EC2-DT, a single dry cooling tower ideal for colder climates (-20°C to 26°C) with Chinese CCSC electrical certification. The EC3, a Plate Heat Exchanger system, is designed to redirect and repurpose generated heat to an external system.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eAll Links \/ Book Consultation -  \u003ca data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/linktr.ee\/bitcoincapitalist\u0026amp;source=gmail\u0026amp;ust=1699233409632000\u0026amp;usg=AOvVaw2aUhsc6nxqgxEyd0_IO95t\" href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/bitcoincapitalist\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/bitcoincapitalist\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003ehttps:\/\/\u003cspan class=\"il\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003elinktr\u003c\/span\u003e.\u003cspan class=\"il\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eee\u003c\/span\u003e\/\u003cwbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003ebitcoincapitalist\u003c\/wbr\u003e\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Bitcoin Capitalist","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":47835094974751,"sku":"HydroContainer","price":100000.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0747\/5491\/6639\/files\/IMG_8635_f7bd02c0-295a-4c5c-8292-83def404fb00.jpg?v=1709873592","url":"https:\/\/bitcoincapitalist.io\/products\/bitmain-hydro-mining-container","provider":"Bitcoin Capitalist ","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
